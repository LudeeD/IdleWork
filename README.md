# IdleWork
Useful script to make you look like you're working and also look awesome doing so.

+ You're in a classroom, not doing what you're supposed to, and your teacher is approaching you... You open the terminal and all you can do is write "ls" in the home directory. The teacher gives you THAT unimpressed look.

+ You're on your computer and that pretty girl you like walks in the room. To impress her you open the terminal but all you can write is "ping www.google.com". Once more, you get THAT unimpressed look.

+ You're at home and browsing the web. Your mother walks in to ask for help and you want to look busy, but all you can do is open the terminal and simply write "echo Hello World". She has seen it a thousand times and, once again, gives you THAT unimpressed look.

If you can relate to any of the situations described above, this script is for you.
